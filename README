Installation:
=============
> make
> make install

The 'make install' command can take some arguments:
prefix = global prefix for installation (default = $HOME)
libdir = directory where the libs should be installed (default = prefix/lib)
bindir = directory where the binaries should be installed (default = prefix/bin)

So
> make prefix=$HOME install # install in your home ($HOME/bin and $HOME/lib)
> make libdir=$PWD  install # install bin in $HOME/bin, but use the development lib


Usage:
======

Once install, you have 3 scripts:
> inject
> injectgraph
> injecthexdump


* inject:
Wrapper to preload the library again the program you want to run. You can specify
the ruleset file to use (default is $PWD/libinject.rules)

eg:
> inject -c myrules -- myprog with its arguments

You can refer to 'inject -h' to get help.


* injectgraph
Build a graph from the output of the 'log' action.

> injectgraph -h


* injecthexdump
Display content of the output of the 'dump' action.

> injecthexdump -h


You can get information about ruleset syntax by generating doxygen documentation :
> make doc

And reading the content of the "Action rule", "Action action" and "Action condition" modules
